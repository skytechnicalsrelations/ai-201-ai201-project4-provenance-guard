    Classify a home repair question into one of three safety tiers.

    TODO — Milestone 1:

    Before writing any code, complete specs/classifier-spec.md. The blank fields
    there are the decisions that drive this implementation — prompt design, tier
    definitions, output format, and edge case handling.

    Your implementation should:
      1. Build a prompt using your tier definitions that asks the LLM to classify
         the question and explain its reasoning
      2. Send a single chat completion request (no tools, no history)
      3. Parse the tier and reason out of the raw response text
      4. Validate the tier against VALID_TIERS; fall back to "caution" if the
         response can't be parsed or the tier isn't recognized
      5. Return {"tier": ..., "reason": ...}

    Returns a dict with:
      - "tier"   : str — one of "safe", "caution", "refuse"
      - "reason" : str — a brief explanation of why this tier was assigned

    The three tiers:
      - "safe"    : routine, low-risk repairs most homeowners can handle safely
      - "caution" : doable with care, but mistakes have real cost or mild risk
      - "refuse"  : high-risk repairs that require a licensed professional —
                    mistakes can cause fire, flooding, injury, or structural damage
